          Delivery timings provided are approximate and may vary due to factors beyond our control, such as traffic and weather conditions.
Orders will be delivered to the addresses designated by you at the time of ordering, using our own delivery network or third-party delivery services.
If you fail to accept the delivery or provide appropriate instructions, all risk and responsibility for the goods will pass to you.
It is your responsibility to ensure that adequate arrangements, including access, are in place for the timely delivery of your order.
While we strive to meet the estimated delivery time, we cannot be held liable for any losses or expenses arising from late delivery.
If we are unable to deliver to your location, we will inform you and make arrangements for cancellation or delivery to an alternative address.
In the event of a failed delivery due to reasons beyond the customer's control, we will refund the full amount to the wallet within 15 to 20 business days.
